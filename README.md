# Reframe
Reframe is an open-source streaming platform dedicated to films and stories that challenge Western-centric perspectives and highlight underrepresented voices.
The goal is to build a transparent, community-driven space where filmmakers can upload their work and audiences can discover, share, and engage with diverse perspectives.
Developed as part of a Prototype Fund project, Reframe combines thoughtful curation, open technology, and social exchange.
Reframe â€“ stories that shift the frame.
